# 100 Days Of Code - Log

On September 22, 2020 I committed to #100DaysOfFrontEnd where I’ll be sharing everything I’m working on related to frontend development. Personal projects, courses I'm taking, tech reads, researching, testing, and many more!

### Day 1: September 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Random Quote Machine generator in React.

**Today's Learning**: Finished the React JS course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44).

**Thoughts:** This is the first time when I try to build an application in React.
For this app, I've decided to use create-react-app. I've tried a couple of APIs to fetch data but, eventually, I decided to stick to Forismatic API. In the beginning, I've decided just to try slowly to use React, components, props, fetch and display data.

### Day 2: September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Today's Learning**: I reviewed my notes from the FCC React course and I've also read through React docs. I'm planning on continuing to do so the next days as well.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time thinking more on the HTML structure since before I had a bunch of <div> tags. I refactored a bit the code since at the beginning I didn't know where to start with React. I decided to keep saving in the state only the information I needed. Made the "New Quote" button to generate a new random quote by making every time a new request to the API. Made the "Twitter" link work and now I am able to post the quote on Twitter.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

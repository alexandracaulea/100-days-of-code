# 100 Days Of Code - Log

On September 22, 2020 I committed to #100DaysOfFrontEnd where I’ll be sharing everything I’m working on related to frontend development. Personal projects, courses I'm taking, tech reads, researching, testing, and many more!

### Day 1: September 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Random Quote Machine generator in React.

**Today's Learning**: Finished the React JS course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44).

**Thoughts:** This is the first time when I try to build an application in React.
For this app, I've decided to use create-react-app. I've tried a couple of APIs to fetch data but, eventually, I decided to stick to Forismatic API. In the beginning, I've decided just to try slowly to use React, components, props, fetch and display data.

### Day 2: September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Today's Learning**: I reviewed my notes from the FCC React course and I've also read through React docs. I'm planning on continuing to do so the next days as well.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time thinking more on the HTML structure since before I had a bunch of `<div>` tags. I refactored a bit the code since at the beginning I didn't know where to start with React. I decided to keep saving in the state only the information I needed. Made the "New Quote" button to generate a new random quote by making every time a new request to the API. Made the "Twitter" link work and now I am able to post the quote on Twitter.

### Day 3: September 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time trying out different styles for the app and implementing it. Decided to try out styled components for the very first time. Deployed the app to Netlify

I’ve created in Trello a card with all the things I have to add/change to the app (eg. add loader, remove comments and unnecessary files).

**Today's Learning**: I’ve learned that styled components are a css-in-js tool and their goal is to give a flexible way to style components. It makes more sense for me when I’ve read the sentence: “When you create a styled component, you are creating a React component with styles” (source Smashing Magazine).
I’ve learned about the “createGlobalStyle” function used to style the global elements like html and body.
I’ve also set up a shortcut in VS Code in order to make the css style be sorted ascending.

I've read:

- Useful article about styled components: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/styled-components-react/
- Docs styled components: https://styled-components.com/docs/basics

### Day 4: September 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:** Today I had only 1 h to code so I decided to spend it continuing to work on the “Inspirational Quote Generator” in React. I’ve managed to configure Airbnb Style Guide and ESLint and improved the code based on the feedback received from ESLint. I’ve also removed unnecessary code and files, added meta tags, updated the title and added favicons. I still have a few things to work on and improve the app, but I’ll do it in the next period.

### Day 5: September 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:**

### 1. Fixed error “SyntaxError Unexpected Token in JSON”

Today I've worked on fixing the error “SyntaxError Unexpected Token in JSON”. I've seen that from time to time, the response received from the API was a string.

As an example, whenever inside of the quoteText was a backslash, the response received from the API was a string.

```json
{
  "quoteText": "I can't imagine a person becoming a success who doesn't give this game of life everything hes got.",
  "quoteAuthor": "Walter Cronkite",
  "senderName": "",
  "senderLink": "",
  "quoteLink": "http://forismatic.com/en/342c3061d1/"
}
```

As a result of that, I've switched from the `fetch` API in using the Axios library and integrated additional logic in order to handle the "string" response received from the API.

I've spent a lot of time figuring out how to fix this issue, mainly in the console, the network tab and researching online.

### 2. Decided to start using branches instead of committing code to master.

### 3. Small improvements to the project:

- Learned how to animate the octo arm path
- Learned that we can use `css` API which allows us to construct reusable CSS blocks (I’ve created a separate file called “mixins.js” repeated styles are added.
- Learned that styled-components can incorporate animations by using the `keyframes` helper which generates a UNIQUE instance.
- Learned how to target another styled component on hover
- Learned that we can interpolate other styled-components to refer to their automatically generated class names

### **Another update for yesterday:**

1. I officially registered for Hacktoberfest 2020, I’m super excited and scared at the same time.
2. Used `git reflog` and `git reset --soft` for the very first time. I accidentally merged master into develop (What can I say? I will not code after 10 PM in the evening).

### Day 6: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my website.

**Thoughts:** Today I've worked on my website: added relevant information for each project, improved the overall layout, removed a couple of projects and reorganized the content.

### Day 7: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:** Today I've implemented a loader for the “Inspirational Quote Generator” in React. Instead of using a package for the loader, I've decided to implement one by myself using styled-components. Also, I've organized a bit my code since it was a bit confusing while reading it.

I want to spend the end of the day reading through the React docs for at least 1 hour.

### Day 8: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:**

Coding update: I've added state for the button and links. Extended the RegEx expression that I had in the code (Context: from time to time the response received from the API contains non-word characters like slashes, quotes etc.)
Today I also focused on accessibility, by testing the app using NVDA screen reader and improved the code in order for the app to be accessible.

Also went to a JSHeroes meetup online event about JavaScript Generators which was super interesting and nerdy (which I loved). Took a bunch of notes, need to experiment a bit with them.

### Day 9: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:**

Coding update:

Last day where I've worked on the "Inspirational Quote Generator" project in React. I created an issue to add tests in the near feature since this is the first project where I used React.
I added a default state if the response returned from the API is an empty string for the author.

For the next days I will be able to code for only 1 hour (family is visiting), so I'm not sure how much I will achieve.

Also went to an UI testing meetup organized by Academia Testarii which opened a new horizontal for me regarding testing which was very insightful for me as a junior dev.

### Day 10: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on "My Projects" page.

**Thoughts:**

Since today I had only 1 hour to code (family is visiting), I decided to focus on "My Projects" page. This page is a list of all the projects that I've built so far while learning to code.

I started working with branches and removed redundant code. Started adding a description for each project that I've built. I still have to add more and focus a bit on the layout, since it looks a bit funky, but I'm getting there.

### Day 11: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on "My Projects" page.

**Thoughts:** Since today I had only 1 hour to code (family is visiting), I decided to continue working on "My Projects" page. This page is a list of all the projects that I've built so far while learning to code. I've continued adding a description for the projects and improved the overall page.

### Day 12: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: No coding.

**Thoughts:** I decided to take a day off from coding since I could not find time for doing it while the family was around. Enjoying a full day with the family is always rewarding and it is like a reminder that sometimes is ok to take a break.

### Day 13: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the "Markdown Previewer" project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've installed all the dependencies that I needed for this project.Today I've also had a job interview which went well and is something that keeps me focused on my goals.

### Day 15: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the "Markdown Previewer" project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Instead of focusing on how the app looks, I've decided to try out React hooks and refactor the code a bit.

**Live example**: https://markdown-previewer-project.netlify.app/

### Day 16: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Markdown Previewer" project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Since I'm using "marked" package which parses and compiles markdown I've decided to not use styled-components and stick with CSS. I've experimented with different layouts, but eventually, I've decided to have a 2 column layout for this project. I still want to continue experimenting with the styles to see if I can come up with something different.

**Online Event:** I've also participated in an online event about React and TDD ("React + TDD === ♥️", presented by Siri Lööf and hosted by David Pallinder and Dafna Rosenblum) . Since I'm currently learning React, this meetup came at the right time.

### Day 17: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've decided to add more content in the Editor textarea and the header elements. Also, I took the content from the header and move it to a separate component.

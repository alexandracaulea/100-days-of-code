# 100 Days Of Code - Log

On September 22, 2020 I committed to #100DaysOfFrontEnd where I’ll be sharing everything I’m working on related to frontend development. Personal projects, courses I'm taking, tech reads, researching, testing, and many more!

### Day 1: September 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Random Quote Machine generator in React.

**Today's Learning**: Finished the React JS course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44).

**Thoughts:** This is the first time when I try to build an application in React.
For this app, I've decided to use create-react-app. I've tried a couple of APIs to fetch data but, eventually, I decided to stick to Forismatic API. In the beginning, I've decided just to try slowly to use React, components, props, fetch and display data.

### Day 2: September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Today's Learning**: I reviewed my notes from the FCC React course and I've also read through React docs. I'm planning on continuing to do so the next days as well.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time thinking more on the HTML structure since before I had a bunch of `<div>` tags. I refactored a bit the code since at the beginning I didn't know where to start with React. I decided to keep saving in the state only the information I needed. Made the "New Quote" button to generate a new random quote by making every time a new request to the API. Made the "Twitter" link work and now I am able to post the quote on Twitter.

### Day 3: September 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time trying out different styles for the app and implementing it. Decided to try out styled components for the very first time. Deployed the app to Netlify

I’ve created in Trello a card with all the things I have to add/change to the app (eg. add loader, remove comments and unnecessary files).

**Today's Learning**: I’ve learned that styled components are a css-in-js tool and their goal is to give a flexible way to style components. It makes more sense for me when I’ve read the sentence: “When you create a styled component, you are creating a React component with styles” (source Smashing Magazine).
I’ve learned about the “createGlobalStyle” function used to style the global elements like html and body.
I’ve also set up a shortcut in VS Code in order to make the css style be sorted ascending.

I've read:

- Useful article about styled components: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/styled-components-react/
- Docs styled components: https://styled-components.com/docs/basics

### Day 4: September 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Inspirational Quote Generator project.

**Thoughts:** Today I had only 1 h to code so I decided to spend it continuing to work on the “Inspirational Quote Generator” in React. I’ve managed to configure Airbnb Style Guide and ESLint and improved the code based on the feedback received from ESLint. I’ve also removed unnecessary code and files, added meta tags, updated the title and added favicons. I still have a few things to work on and improve the app, but I’ll do it in the next period.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
